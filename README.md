A starter theme called materialized_s, or underscores.

## Description

This theme aims to provide the starting point if you want to create a WP page with materializecss.

The goal is to be able to reproduce something like the following example easily:
https://materializecss.com/templates/parallax-template/preview.html

Tip: You can get free images from pixabay.com to replicate it :)

## Usage

Although you can use it in any way you want, the ideal is to place a child theme so your custom modifications
won't stop you from updating materialize_s. A child theme is already prepared to start developing:

```
cd wp-content/themes/
git clone https://github.com/nicovell3/materialized_s
cp -r materialized_s/childtheme materialized_custom
```

## Installation

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload Theme and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.
